NOTE:
"blink" is the one shown and demonstrated in the video. It proves I can connect my arduino nano 33 IoT to the cloud and use a basic blink program. This program outputs my name in morse code (Logan). 
"blinkPushButton" is the one not demonstrated but was shown. Due to my internet issues, I was unable to demonstrate it. It however is functional and uses the cloud widget to change the pushButtonState variable which controls the blinking..
